# Art bible — Farm Life 3D overhaul

Step 1 of the two-week overhaul. Everything after this step inherits these
decisions, so each one below is *verified* rather than assumed: every asset
named here was downloaded, parsed, and rendered before it was written down.

Pinned: **2026-09-06**.

## 1. What the network allows (the constraint that reshaped the plan)

The overhaul plan named Kenney.nl, Quaternius and Mixamo as asset sources.
None of them are reachable from this environment. Measured:

| Host | Result |
|---|---|
| `raw.githubusercontent.com` | ✅ 200 |
| `registry.npmjs.org` | ✅ 200 |
| `github.com` (git clone/push) | ✅ works |
| `kenney.nl`, `quaternius.com` | ❌ egress-blocked |
| `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `unpkg.com` | ❌ egress-blocked |
| `api.github.com`, `codeload.github.com` | ❌ 403 |
| `poly.pizza`, Mixamo, YouTube | ❌ blocked |

**Consequence:** assets come from GitHub raw or npm, and get vendored into the
repo. That was going to be true anyway — the game precaches its shell and must
run with the network off, so a runtime CDN was never an option.

## 2. Asset source

**[`shorepine/kenney`](https://github.com/shorepine/kenney)** @ commit
`3694c6879e487c108f55677be7dd2ca75b07cc3b` — a CC0 mirror of Kenney's library,
4,812 glTF-binary models across 49 kits, textures beside the models they belong
to. All art is Kenney's, released **CC0** (`LICENSE.txt` in that repo).

Fetch pattern, one file at a time, no tarball needed:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorepine/kenney/<commit>/3d/<kit>/<model>.glb
```

Secondary source, for engine pieces rather than art —
**[`mrdoob/three.js`](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) @ r169** (MIT):
`examples/jsm/objects/Sky.js` (procedural physical sky, drives the day/night
cycle), `objects/Water.js` + `textures/waternormals.jpg` (step 9),
`jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js`, `jsm/postprocessing/*` (step 4).

> `GLTFLoader.js` imports `../utils/BufferGeometryUtils.js`, so vendoring a jsm
> module means vendoring its dependency tree. Step 2 read this as an argument
> for npm and a bundler; it turned out to be twenty lines of `tools/vendor.mjs`
> instead, and the game kept its zero-build-step property. See that file.

## 3. Kits in, kits out

**In:**

| Kit | Models | What it gives us |
|---|---|---|
| `nature` | 329 | Crops *with growth stages*, tilled dirt rows, fences, trees, bushes, flowers, grass, logs, stumps, cliffs, bridges |
| `cube-pets` | 24 | The herd — animated (`idle`/`walk`/`run`/`eat`) |
| `blocky-characters` | 18 | The farmer — 27 clips, verified working |
| `survival` | 80 | Tools (hoe, axe, shovel), barrels, boxes, chest, signposts, rocks |
| `city-suburban` | 40 | Farmhouse candidates, paths, driveways, garden fences |
| `fantasy-town` | 167 | Windmill, market stalls, roof/wall pieces to assemble a barn |
| `food` | 200 | Produce for inventory and market UI |

**Out, with reasons:**

- **`mini-characters`** — looked ideal (6 female + 6 male, 32 clips including
  `pick-up` and `interact-right`, plus wheelchair and mobility-aid clips). It is
  **broken in this export**: 10 nodes and 2 skins for a whole humanoid, with only
  7 nodes actually animated. Rendered, it stands with its arms splayed
  horizontally in every clip including bind pose. Verified against a known-good
  control (three.js `Soldier.glb`, 68 nodes / 52 animated) that renders
  perfectly through the identical code path — so this is the asset, not us.
- **`Soldier.glb` / `RobotExpressive.glb`** — technically excellent, wrong
  world. A photoreal soldier in a cozy farm is a worse mismatch than a blocky
  farmer.
- **Mixamo** — needs a login, host unreachable.

## 4. The scale contract

The kits do **not** share a world scale. Measured bounding boxes:

| Asset | Authored size (units) |
|---|---|
| `nature/fence_simple` | 1.00 w × 0.35 h |
| `nature/crops_dirtRow` | 1.00 × 0.62 |
| `nature/tree_default` | 1.71 h |
| `nature/crop_pumpkin` | 0.44 |
| `blocky-characters/character-a` | **2.70 h** |
| `cube-pets/animal-cow` | **1.65 h** |
| `cube-pets/animal-chick` | **2.23 w** (bigger than the cow) |

**Rule: the Nature Kit is the reference.** It is authored on a clean 1-unit grid
that already matches this game's 1-unit plot tiles, so it maps onto the existing
world with no conversion. Everything else is normalised to it on load:

Cube Pets are authored at a uniform "pet" size regardless of the real animal, so
each species needs its own correction to restore relative size.

**Implemented as target heights, not multipliers.** `assets.js` measures the
model on load and scales it to a stated height, so the table reads as what it
means and survives an asset being swapped for one of a different authored size:

| Model | Target height |
|---|---|
| `nature/*` | as authored — the reference |
| `blocky-characters/character-{a,b}` | 1.7 |
| `cube-pets/animal-cow` | 0.9 |
| `cube-pets/animal-polar` (sheep stand-in) | 0.75 |
| `cube-pets/animal-dog` | 0.45 |
| `cube-pets/animal-chick` | 0.4 |
| `cube-pets/animal-cat` | 0.35 |

One table, in `assets.js`, applied at load — never per-instance magic numbers.

## 5. Entity → asset map

Crops keep the game's existing three-stage growth model. The Nature Kit
supplies real stage models, including a generic sprout that matches the "young
plot is a generic sprout, not yet the crop it will become" beat the 2D game
already had:

| Crop | Sprout | Growing | Ripe |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wheat | `crops_leafsStageA` | `crops_wheatStageA` | `crops_wheatStageB` |
| Corn | `crops_leafsStageA` | `crops_cornStageB` | `crops_cornStageD` |
| Carrot | `crops_leafsStageA` | `crops_leafsStageB` | `crop_carrot` |
| Pumpkin | `crops_leafsStageA` | `crops_leafsStageB` | `crop_pumpkin` |

| Entity | Asset |
|---|---|
| Soil tile | `nature/crops_dirtSingle`, `crops_dirtRow` (+ corner/end pieces) |
| Field & pen fence | `nature/fence_simple`, `fence_corner`, `fence_gate` |
| Farmer (f/m) | `blocky-characters/character-{a,b}` — clips `idle`, `walk`, `sprint`, `interact-*`, `pick-up`, `sit`, `emote-yes/no` |
| Cow / chicken / dog / cat | `cube-pets/animal-{cow,chick,dog,cat}` — clips `idle`, `walk`, `run`, `eat` |
| Farmhouse | `city-suburban/building-type-a` |
| Windmill, market stall | `fantasy-town/windmill`, `stall`, `stall-green` |
| Tools, crates, rocks | `survival/tool-hoe`, `barrel`, `box`, `chest`, `rock-a..c` |
| Foliage (instanced) | `nature/grass`, `grass_large`, `plant_bush`, `flower_{red,yellow,purple}A` |
| Trees | `nature/tree_default`, `tree_detailed`, `tree_fat` |

**Seasons come free:** every nature tree ships `_default`, `_dark` and `_fall`
variants. Step 13's autumn is a model swap, not a shader.

## 6. Two gaps, and what to do about them

**There is no sheep.** Not in Cube Pets, not anywhere in 4,812 models (the only
hit in the whole library is a hexagon terrain tile). The game's economy needs
sheep for wool, so swapping the species would break it.

- Default: `cube-pets/animal-polar` at ×0.5, tinted cream. It is a white,
  rounded quadruped and reads as woolly at play distance.
- Fallback: keep the existing hand-built faceted sheep. It already reads well,
  and one procedural model among kit models is a smaller cost than a bear.
- Decide in step 11, by looking at both. Do not spend longer than that on it.

**There is no barn or silo,** and the game sells Small Barn / Large Barn as
hurricane shelters. Assemble one from `fantasy-town` roof and wall pieces, or
use a second `city-suburban/building-type-*` at a larger scale. Step 7.

## 7. Budget

A complete 44-asset shortlist covering every entity above: **1.75 MB**, largest
single file 267 KB. For comparison the current shell already ships a 670 KB
`three.module.js`.

That is small enough to **precache the whole asset set in the service worker**.
No lazy-loading, no streaming, no loading-screen machinery — step 2 keeps the
offline-first promise with the same precache-on-install approach the game uses
today. Anything that pushes this past ~4 MB should be reconsidered rather than
lazily loaded.

## 8. Palette

Sampled from the kits rather than invented, so the UI and the scene agree:

| Role | Hex |
|---|---|
| Grass / ground | `#7FAE55` |
| Sky, day | `#9ED0F0` |
| Tilled soil | `#8A6A47` |
| Fence / timber | `#9E6B43` |
| Foliage, mid | `#3E7A46` |
| Sun / warm light | `#FFF3D6` |

Day/night colour ramps stay as they are: the 2D sky strip and the 3D scene
already read the same clock through `daySkyState()`, and that stays the single
source of truth.

## 9. Movement model

Confirmed, per decision 02 of the overhaul plan: **direct control with a
following third-person camera.** The tap-to-queue-a-walk mechanic retires in
step 6. Interaction becomes proximity plus a prompt — walk up to a plot, press
the button.

The accessibility consequence is not optional and is not deferred: the invisible
`#plotsGrid` button layer is the game's entire keyboard and screen-reader story,
and free movement invalidates it. Step 12 replaces it, and step 12 is on the
"never cut" list for exactly this reason.

## Verified, not assumed

Everything above was checked before it was written:

- Every named asset was downloaded and its glTF JSON parsed for meshes, nodes,
  skins and animation clips.
- Nature Kit props, Cube Pets animals and a character were rendered together in
  one scene to confirm the kits read as a single visual language. They do.
- The character was rendered in bind pose, `idle` and `walk`, beside a
  known-good control, which is how `mini-characters` was caught and
  `blocky-characters` chosen.
- Sizes are measured bounding boxes, not estimates. The shortlist total is
  measured `content-length`, not a guess.

Probe scripts live outside the repo, in the session scratchpad. They were
throwaway; this document is what they were for.
